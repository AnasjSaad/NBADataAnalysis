# NBADataAnalysis

This was a fun learning project I did after I learned SQL. I am a huge basketball fan but this was the first time actually preforming data analysis on nba statistics. Some interesting trends were discovered that I would like to share!

The csv file of the data that I took off sql is included in this repository along with 2 SQL files and 1 other python file. 

1. The file 'Load_nbastats' is used to load the csv data on sql. You run the create table command and then import the data using the CSV file attached. 

2. The second file is 'NBA_Analysis' which includes all the discoveries and tables created while cleaning and analyzing the data.

3. The third file 'NBAVisualized' Loads in the tables used and created through the SQL file and visualizes some of the data through different plots.
